# Roulettes
Roulette apps that chose possible winning combinations

**Assignment**
You are to write a program that models a roulette wheel. The ball can fall randomly into
one of 38 different bins. You are to calculate all the winning bets according to the bin the ball falls into.
Use arrays to model this game. You should use two arrays to model the wheel (numbers and colors).
You can use arrays as appropriate to determine the winning bets.
As output, your program should print the winning bin to standard output, together with all the winning
bets. For example, if the ball comes to rest in square 26, the winning Split bets could be 23/26, 26/27,
26/29, and 25/26, while the winning Corner bets could be 22/23/25/26, 23/24/26/27, 25/26/28/29, and
26/27/29/30.
